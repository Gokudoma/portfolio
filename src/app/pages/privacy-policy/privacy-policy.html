  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>Data Protection</h2>
  <p>
    I take the protection of your personal data very seriously. I treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact Form</h2>
  <p>
    If you send me inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there, will be stored by the service provider (Formspree) for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. I will not share this data without your consent.
  </p>
  <p>
    The processing of the data entered into the contact form is therefore based exclusively on your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR). You can revoke this consent at any time. An informal message by e-mail to me is sufficient. The legality of the data processing operations carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
